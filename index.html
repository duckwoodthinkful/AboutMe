      <h2>Hello, I am Abe Krebs</h2>
      <p>I live in Pennsylvania and I make laboratory equipment for use in electrochemistry.  Electrochemistry covers all kinds of interesting
        topics, including batteries, corrosion, and solar cells.  I bet you are using something every day that deals with electrochemistry!

      <h2>About Abe</h2>
      <p>I attend Penn State University for both my undergraduate and graduate degrees in <em>Engineering Science and Mechanics</em>. I have been working for over 25
        years
        in the field of electrochemistry. I have been writing code since I had my first computer, a CP/M based <a href="https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=610">Televideo TS802</a>.</p>
      <p>I am trying to become more educated about some of the relevant technologies used in today's web applications.  I look forward to working with others who are interested in learning about these technologies.
